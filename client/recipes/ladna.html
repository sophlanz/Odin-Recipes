        <h2> <em>Description </em> </h2>
            <p1>Ladna is a popular Thai dish, consisting of wide rice noodles,
                <em>whose texture alone will send your tastebuds to heaven,</em> your choice of protein,
                chinese brocoli, and soy sauce. It was one of the more authentic Thai dishes that I fell
                in love with during my time living in Thailand. Although, it's not considered anything 
                special by the locals, ladna will always be one of the dishes I miss most in Thailand.
