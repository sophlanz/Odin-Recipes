        <h2> <em>Description </em> </h2>
        <p1> Pad-kee-mao is a Thai noodle dish, that is known for its wide array of flavors, and the spicy kicks
            that will leave your mouth tingling for relief - <em>in a good way</em>. I would only reccomend this dish to spicy food enthusiasts. If you remove 
            this aspect of the plate, you're better off going for a sweeter noodle dish, such as Pad-thai or Pad-see-ew. 
            This was a favorite lunch meal of mine throughout my time in Thailand.
